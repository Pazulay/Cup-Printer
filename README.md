# Cup Printer

This is my first Vue application called 'Cup Printer'.
The purpose of this app is to have a easy-to-use dashboard to print labels with ingredients using thermal printers that you can put on a cup if you sell smoothies or coffee.
For this I used a open source Vue plugin called vue-html-to-paper that extracts a piece of html code and transforms it into a printable format with added windows print functionality.
This is a link to the plugin [vue-html-to-paper](https://github.com/mycurelabs/vue-html-to-paper)
